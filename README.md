## APPLICATIONS

 - [Signup Sheets: {STATUS: INCOMPLETE. IN DEVELOPMENT.} This tool lets any user create a sheet with openings at specific times, and then allows other users to sign up for those openings. This is analogous to a list of times and dates on a piece of paper that is passed around or posted on a door and on which people would put their name - e.g. signing up for a particular lab slot, scheduling office hours, picking a study group time, or more general things like planning a party.](https://github.com/williamscollege/lti/tree/master/lti-signup-sheets) - [view screenshot](http://www.screencast.com/ "Signup Sheets (LTI application)")
