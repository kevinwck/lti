			<tr>
				<td height="23" width="700">In my experience, blackboard has been
					mostly used to post documents that were handed out in class, or media
					presentations used in conjunction with the class (including powerpoint
					presentations and overhead projections). Having those documents readily
					available online is useful if, say, one missed the class (which I would
					never do of course!), lost the document, or needed to see it when the
					hardcopy was not readily available (computers are everywhere!). I'd have
					to say that I still believe that blackboard is underutilized by many,
					but I this may be due to the fact that some of the blackboard features
					are as readily available, if not more so, in a student's own computer
					setup. Specifically (and this is all based on my own experience):
					Teachers don't use the announcement feature so much because an e-mail is
					just as easy and is checked more often than blackboard. On the other
					hand, if a fellow student in the class needed to get in touch with
					another person in that class or the whole class, blackboard allows them
					to do just that without having to harvest e-mail addresses. I've never
					seen a student actually do this, possibly for fear of other students
					becoming annoyed by such an act. The online scheduler is quite a fancy
					feature, and I would have immediately coordinated my schedule/planner
					with it, but my Microsoft Outlook already has my whole life in order,
					and I don't need to be on the network to have that available, and my
					planner is with me on the go, so there's really no advantage I can see.
					For courses that require online discussions/postings, blackboard is
					superior to e-mail correspondence. Nobody likes 30 or so e-mails over
					the span of a week, all pertaining to, say, naked mole-rats, clogging
					their inbox. If blackboard could organize those kinds of assignments
					into a better user interface, that would be great; I'm picturing some
					sort of virtual discussion board...and by that I mean something better
					than a long list of people's postings in the order they were received.
					So boring, and not very inviting to read. Few people actually post a
					response to another person's post, but I think that a better
					presentation of the discussion board interface would facilitate such
					postings. And while I absolutely love the idea of a virtual classroom
					setting ala Microsoft Netmeeting, i can't imagine many people would be
					open to the idea outside of a one-on-one, student-to-prof (or maybe
					one-or-two-student-to-prof) kind of setting. Submitting assignments
					through blackboard is not something I can say i've done (maybe once, but
					I can't even remember what or for which class it was) but I would think
					that a prof would also prefer that method over e-mail for the same
					reasons I would prefer blackbarod over the e-mailing of discussion
					posts. It's like spam....smart, academic spam, but spam nonetheless. I
					hope this helps!

					on blackboard throughout the semester. This final class did however

					I believe more professors should get into the habit of using Blackboard

					track of. In addition, I know it would be very helpful for the college
					to look into the idea of creating online course packets. With regard to
					both copyright laws especially , as well as health benefits to the
					student (ok, not having to lug around heavy course packets or clutter up

				<td height="23" width="700">Though four of my classes were
					registered on Blackboard, only two of the classes used it. In on of the
					classes, the professor used Blackboard primarily to distribute problem
					sets, answer keys, and practice tests. This was beneficial because it
					cuts down on the amount of paper that was used.

					In the second class, the professor used Blackboard mostly for
					distributing images and video clips. The still images were far better
					in color on Blackboard than a printed black and white version. The
					video clips were most easily broadcast to the greatest number of people
					via Blackboard. Most of the videos were old news clips that are not in
					the library, so it would have been difficult to arrange a viewing or put
					them on reserve. Also, the frequency with which we used them made it
					impractical to view as a group on a consistent. However, and this is
					really my only complaint, the video clips were PAINFULLY SLOW to
					download, and half the time the links didn't work at all. It is
					particularly frustrating to deal with this when you are in the middle of
					writing a paper or response about the clips.

					Otherwise, I thought that Blackboard was about the same as before. My
					professors chose not to use Blackboard as must as they have in the past,
					so I don't much experience with some of the newer features.

				<td height="23" width="700">I think Blackboard's problems are

					* "OK" buttons are always a bad thing -- you have no idea what's going
					to happen when you click them!
					* Buttons on the left for things like "Syllabus" should automatically
					not appear if the prof has not posted one online
					* The most useful features should be front and center, easiest to access
					from the beginning, while less used features can be in subfolders.
					* At least one class has chosen to use WSO's forum instead of
					Blackboard's. A clear signal that Blackboard's discussion system leaves
					much to be desired.
					* Two of my classes this semester had their own web sites completely
					designed by the profs for posting announcements, assignments and useful
					links, and didn't use blackboard at all (except for turning in
					assignments in one case). I think it would be useful to look at these
					pages and see how professors would actually like their information
					displayed, and what information they care about.

					In sum, I think Blackboard has huge potential, but it is currently being
					severely undermined by all these user interface problems.

					blackboard as often as they check their email, and using blackboard for
					online class discourse feels forced and unproductive compared to genuine
					discussion. I could pay state-university tuition and "learn" using
					online facilities similar to blackboard; I came to Williams because the
					Williams curriculum emphasizes the educative value of students'
					relationships with their professors and with their peers--relationships
					which, I feel, Blackboard does nothing to further, and from which it may
					even detract. Although I'll grant you that conducting academic
					administration online seems very modern and technologically savvy, such
					techno-chic is no guarantor of a better experience. Twenty years from
					now, I doubt I'll wish I'd spent more time on my computer during

				<td height="23" width="700">I have been generally disatisfied with

					However, I think some of it is inherent. I think the menu system could
					benefit from not allowing profs to have default folder labels, but set
					up ones appropriate to their course. Also good would be a autoreminder
					system that alerts students when a post is made to a given folder.
					Right now, blackboard is often inferior to simply emailing documents to
					students because we have to seek out information that is not posted
					regularly. Perhaps i should be using it as a default page for my
					browser or checking it more often, but I think this is an issue.
					Note:i'm not sure if the program is served online, but the access is
					often VERY slow. If it could be accessed directly on-campus so that
					there was no wait-time, it would be a vast improvement.
