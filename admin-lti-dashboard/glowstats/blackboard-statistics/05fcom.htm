					Black board didn't aid in learning at all, blackboard discussions are
					never insightful and I know that I personally put about three minutes of
					thought into the discussion posts. The Discussion boards are just
					another assignment that I forget to do (because it's online) and
					half-ass at the last minute. Blackboard's true value is in organizing
					materials for the course(especially media). For my language courses
					which often required daily audio and video work, blackboard was more
					useful than the CD with poorly labeled tracks or the video cds. I
					credit my TAs for getting the information on Blackboard in an organized
					manner.

					also be useful if the class facebook had a link to the student's
					individual facebook page. I feel like that used to be a feature, but no

					online discussion board was helpful in that I could see what other
					people thought about class material, but a discussion never really got

				<td height="23" width="715">though i didn't have any class that used

					presented, brought up, or handed out, available to me online in the
					event that i wanted a reminder or lost the original is very important to
					me. I believe this should be one of the must-haves of blackboard. I
					wish all professors were so good as to have all their paperwork and
					class aides available through this resource. One thing that always
					drove me nuts was having to re-sign in after i closed a blackboard
					window. I understand how this is important for public computers, but
					when i'm constantly referring to a particular paper (usually syllabus or
					calendar) it would be quite a time-saver to stay logged in. I also
					sometimes think that there are too many categories/buttons under which
					professors can list documents available for download. I often find
					myself having to click on several buttons before finding the particular
					site where a desired file is listed.

					less effective, and while i have never had them offered/used them for a
					class, i think they are a negative feature because they promote a less
					personal professor/student interaction.

					this or any suggestions on how to access blackboard. Additionally I was
					added to a class that i was tutoring but was unable to ever access that
					part of blackboard for whatever reason, again no help at all from OIT

				<td height="23" width="715">I'm sure you know this, but Blackboard
					does not work on Macs which aren't running OS X. This meant i couldn't

					affects significant number of students - perhaps only seniors would not
					be operating OS X, and we'll graduate soon, and problem solved - but I
					will be here for another entire semester and feel like I am being
					excluded from the convenience of Blackboard, which seems to be a big
					concern of yours, judging from this survey.

					Bottom line - i think Blackboard is generally great, but having it not
					operate on my own computer is a serious problem.

				<td height="23" width="715">The two main problems with Blackboard is
					that it is clunky--that is, slow and difficult to access because of the
					login, different pages, confusing layout, etc.--and that it is rarely
					integrated into the class very well. For instance, most of my professors
					that have used it have for the most part posted assignments already
					given in class or otherwise used it as a general purpose billboard--if
					you lost your syllabus, here's a place to get another. That's really
					useful, but makes things harder for a professor who wants to use
					Blackboard more centrally (to make announcements, etc.). As a student, I
					need to be convinced that Blackboard can be more than a place to rescue
					lost information. Designing a simpler (and faster loading) front page
					would be a good start from my perspective. Thanks for asking...

					necessarily post the same things, and a facebook would help us email
					someone in another section to get the necessary materials. OR, i
					suppose, you could just link the blackboards for each section of the
					same class.

					blackboard is a great tool! also, one of my profs said she didn't have
					the time to set it up - perhaps if a TA, or someone else, could be hired
					to create a blackboard for a professor who is either unwilling to learn
					or to take the time. that would help her/his class.

					blackboard for discussions or general announcements because students
					don't check it regularly. On the other hand, students rarely check
