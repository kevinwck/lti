				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">The most useful
					aspects of using Blackboard have been online access to course notes,
					homework assignments, and syllabi. I might lose a paper syllabus or it
					might be amended during the semester by the professor so having an
					updated version is extremely useful. Course notes (especially as posted
					by Prof. Rai for ECON251M) provide an excellent form of review for
					exams and problem sets and do not require the hassle of handing out
					these notes in class or purchasing a course handbook.

					My only suggestion would be to require that all professors use
					Blackboard at the very least for posting homework assignments and
					syllabi. I've come to depend on Blackboard for some of my courses and
					it is extremely inconvenient when a professor refuses to help students
					by posting materials there.

					find it extremely distracting that the classes I took last year are

					things on there without telling the class to check it, and some
					professors have it but never use it because they don't know how to use
					the site.

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">A suggestion for
					altering the possible responses to Question 1 in this survey: In
					addition to the third option--that accessing materials online is a
					"negative" because it is less convenient and efficient--I think you
					should provide the option of choosing something to the effect that
					accessing materials online can take longer, but it is not necessarily a
					negative; it can still be preferable to using hard copies since you have
					the option of conserving paper use, etc.

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">Every class I've ever

					be a way to decide which courses appear, or at least put the relevant
					ones at the top.

					Also it would be nice if there was a better way to customize the
					homepage so that you can see what's changed. The "What's New" feature
					sounds good in principle, but instead of only showing what's new, it
					shows everything with a "0" next to things with no new items. It would
					be better if it displayed only a list of what has actually changed.

					student should be able to access the professor's website from
					blackboard, for many profs(ie. Peacock Lopez) have useful material
					posted on their personal websites. I mean just one webpage where one

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">The only reason for

					readings on blackboard for every meeting. Having to go to the library to
					print them out each time was something of an inconvenience. I think in a
					case like that a course packet would be easier to use. However, for
					more occasional readings and all other uses I think that Blackboard is
					very helpful.

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">I find the Blackboard

					code up on Blackboard for us to use and edit, which is very useful. But
					that is the only thing that I have used it for that could not be done
					just as well in other ways.

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">The faults with

					finding the material they need (rather than trying to retain numerous
					handouts, or have to find handouts they might not have received).
				</td>

			<tr>
				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">It's really annoying
					when the professor does not post the syllabus or specific assignments
					discussed in class on Blackboard, or only does sometimes- ideally it
					should be consistent and definitely used (because I, among many, lose
					hard copies easily). I like that all of the classes we've ever taken are
					still listed under "courses" but keeping our current classes separate
					from those would be more organized and convenient. Thanks.
				</td>

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">In most of my
					courses, Blackboard has only been used peripherally. It's nice to have
					the syllabus and calendar available there in case I lose the hard copy,
					and I like the ability to easily get in touch with classmates or post to
					a forum. However, unless something is specifically assigned, I almost
					never visit the site, so it would not be a good place to post regular
					updates to a calendar without also making those changes known through
					email or other direct communication. I also hate reading things online
					and will always print things out to read them, so it takes more time to
					get the reading. But that's not that big a deal. The navigation of the
					site, especially in the forums, has sometimes been complicated, so
					that's something they could work on.
				</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">One of my professors
					posted course notes and the syllabus with the incorrect file extension.
					Though the content of the files themselves were fine, this meant that I
					had to download each file and re-name it before I was able to view it.
					Perhaps all faculty should be instructed how to convert their course
					documents into uniform .pdf files that everyone can read with no hassle.
					This also facilitates directly viewing documents from the web browser,
					which saves time when quickly checking up on assignments.

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">I have two classes

					using the full capacity of the software. One only has the syllabus
					posted and accesses nothing else besides it and the facebook. The other
					infrequently adds announcements and rarely informs students of the
					update. I am not sure why my professors seem so reticent to use this
					program, it seems to have great potential.

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">It would be nice if
					you took off the links to courses on blackboard from previous semesters
					from the list of your blackboard courses that appears when you log in.
					Having so many classes there that are now obsolete just clutters things
					and is unnecessary.

					I like having readings online as a reference and I like the fact that
					they save paper; the reason I said it does not save time is when you run
					into problems printing from blackboard, which especially happens when
					you need to print in color. If students need to print all the readings
					from blackboard anyway, it may be smarter just to make a course packet,
					but having them on blackboard and posted weekly does give the professor
					greater flexibility in choosing them and I appreciate that.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">There are many good
					uses of Blackboard, and I generally find it useful. Some professors use
					PowerPoint for lectures and post the presentation online. My Spanish
					professor posts worksheets and study sheets for exams. In these cases,
					Blackboard is helpful. However, I don't like having readings posted on
					Blackboard, unless there is also a course packet. If the readings are
					only available online, it is a nuisance. It means I have to waste time
					going to the library to print, or waste money by using my own printer
					(ink is expensive). Professors seem to think posting readings online
					saves us time. It doesn't. Ideally, we would get a hard copy of the
					readings and have access to them on Blackboard as well. This would be
					particularly helpful for readings that come with color photos or
					diagrams.

				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">For the ones I chose

			<tr>
				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">Online discussions
					aren't that valuable because responses can become difficult in simply
					choosing which thread to respond to (or creating another). Also a system
					that would notify users when responses to threads and/or new threads
					were posted would be greatly beneficial -- it's annoying and a waste of
					time to have to check back periodically on Blackboard to see if anyone
					has responded or posted something new. Some clearly wouldn't want these
					messages, so a mandatory selection of notifications would be useful
					before beginning the Blackboard communications process.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td bordercolor="blue" height="23" width="715">I think one of the
					strongest plusses of Blackboard is that it saves paper. Many courses

					who wish to do this can print it out themselves.
